Better editing
* Replacement of cards
* Insertion of cards
* Typing - treat card stacks as buttons,
  * Dead-zone for dragging
  * Track active input space
* Merging of cards to form a control group (multitouch?)
* User can change repeat count of card on the table

Execution (reduction, play speech)
  * Cannot edit or undo/redo while action is being executed
  * Animate active action card
  * Can go back to program before run was pressed
  * Run vs edit modes?  E.g. editing while in run mode switches back to edit mode.
  * Execution history -- how to integrate with undo/redo?

Configuration
* Add your own actions
* Select voice

* Save state
  * to local storage
  * to cloud storage

Comprehensibility
* Super-power modes
  * X-Ray vision (graph view of program)
  * Slow down time (step through intermediate reductions)
