Better editing
* Replacement of cards
* Insertion of cards
* Typing - treat card stacks as buttons,
  * Dead-zone for dragging
  * Track active input space
* Merging of cards to form a control group (multitouch?)
* User can change repeat count of card on the table

Execution (reduction, play speech)
  * Cannot edit while action is being executed
  * Animate active action card
  * Can edit fron current point in execution, with action history turned into a seq

Configuration
* Integrate emoji-picker into config dialog

* Save state
  * to local storage
  * to cloud storage

* Accessiblity
  * Keyboard navigation
    * Style focus nicely
    * Tab indices
    * Activate controls with keyboard input

Comprehensibility
* Super-power modes
  * X-Ray vision (graph view of program)
  * Slow down time (step through intermediate reductions)
  * Onion skin (layer execution steps on one another, with translucency)
* Instructions


Tech debt
 - don't allow nullable 'next' program in Reduction (let nop reduce to nop, not null)
